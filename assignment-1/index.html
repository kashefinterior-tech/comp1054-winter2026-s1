          <h2>Why this song matters to me</h2>
          <p>
            This song matters to me because of its connection to
            <em>The Great Gatsby</em> and the way it captures a sad yet jazzy
            atmosphere that feels both glamorous and fragile. The music sounds
            timeless, as if it belongs to another era, while the lyrics express
            a quiet fear of losing love and value over time. I have often
            noticed that this song is played at memorials for young people,
            which gives it an even deeper emotional weight. For me, it
            represents the beauty of youth, the sadness of its fragility, and
            the question of whether love remains when everything else fades.

          <h2>About the artist</h2>
          <p>
            Lana Del Rey is an American singer and songwriter known for her
            cinematic sound and nostalgic aesthetic. Her music often explores
            themes of love, loss, fame, and identity, drawing inspiration from
            vintage Americana and classic Hollywood imagery. “Young and
            Beautiful” reflects her signature style by blending emotional
            vulnerability with lush orchestration. The song became widely
            recognized for its role in <em>The Great Gatsby</em>, where it
            reinforced the film’s themes of glamour, longing, and impermanence.
