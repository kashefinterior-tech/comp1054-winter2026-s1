          <h2>Why this song matters to me</h2>
          <p>
            This song matters to me because of its connection to
            <em>The Great Gatsby</em> and the way it captures a sad yet jazzy
            atmosphere that feels both glamorous and fragile. The music sounds
            timeless, as if it belongs to another era, while the lyrics express
            a quiet fear of losing love and value over time. I have often
            noticed that this song is played at memorials for young people,
            which gives it an even deeper emotional weight. For me, it
            represents the beauty of youth, the sadness of its fragility, and
            the question of whether love remains when everything else fades.
